# Time-frequency-analysis
I had to do a school project to do a time frequency analysis on audio and chirp signal.
This project allows us (if you finish it, and i finished it) to do a Time-Frequency Analysis
for evolutionary signals.

/!\ All my comments are not necessarily in english /!\

For this project and all projects, it was obliged to create a demo version (with a chirp signal)
and a project version (with an audio file).

# Steps

## (demo version) : First I had to create a chirp signal :

> To do the analysis, we needed to create an hamming window and shift this window.

> It's important to make a matrix filled by the multiplication of hamming vector and our initial signal.
Finally, this matrix can be dislayed with the imagesc command.

## (project version) For this version, I created a complete GUI (audio.m) :

> It was important for the project version to let the user to fill intervals to reduce the initial signal.  
> The initial signal is received by using my function get_audio_signal and the function audioread.  
> Finally, the user had to be able to fill the length of hamming window and the length of the increment.
